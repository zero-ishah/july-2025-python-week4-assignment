A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and managed so it can be easily accessed, updated, and retrieved. 
Think of it like a digital filing cabinet, where information is stored in a structured way.
Relational Database (RDBMS): Stores data in tables with relationships (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
NoSQL Database: Stores unstructured or semi-structured data (e.g., MongoDB).
